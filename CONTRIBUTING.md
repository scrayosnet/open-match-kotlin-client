# Contributing

Contribution is possible via merge-requests. Merge requests must adhere to the code and git conventions, shown at
[this link](https://gitlab.scrayos.net/JustChunks/Tasks/-/wikis/Entwicklung/Konventionen) and need to be targeted
against the main-branch. The source-branch should be named after the schema, that is outlined in the conventions
document.
